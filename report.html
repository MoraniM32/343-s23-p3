      <p class="lead">
        The intent of this website is to help find a semi-random movie via a rhyme of a given word.
        It functions like a movie discovery tool, something to use when you dont know what to watch next.
        To do this it utilizes two APIs, Rhymebrain and watchmode.
        The user will enter the word they want rhymes of into the search bar at the top right.
        A list of rhymes buttons will populate the left side of the main portion of the website.
        Clicking on any of these buttons will then ping watchmode for any movies that contain the rhyme in its title.
        These results are packed into cards on the right side of the main section of the website.
        These cards will also include a button that then pings watchmode to get the IMDb ID and generate the URL from that.
        There were a few things done to the link generation to help minimize API calls.
        The Rhyme and Movie sections also self-clear when the user enters a new search or clicks a different rhyme.
      </p>

        I believe that this website satisfies the following requirements with the above introduction giving context.
        <ul>
          <li class="lead">Responsive - The website dynamically shifts the rhyme and movie sections from 2 columns to one and placing
                           the movies below the rhyme buttons.</li>
          <li class="lead">Uses 2 different apis</li>
          <li class="lead">Has Search</li>
          <li class="lead">Display results</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Unfortunately one aspect I believe that hasn't been fully satisfied is the 'results are filterable' as I tried to incorporate this
        via the now disabled radio buttons on the side nav. It can be argued that the results are already self-filtered as
        they only show movies related to the selected rhyme, but there is also no specific filtering or alphabetical sorting going on
        client side, which is why I believe this part has not been satisfied.
